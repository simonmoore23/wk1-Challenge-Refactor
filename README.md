# wk1-Challenge-Refactor

## Description

- I was tasked with making the Horiseon webpage more accesible and SEO friendly
- I built this project to help make the Horiseon Webpage more accessible to viewers who may require screen readers or other assistive technologies.
- By making the Horiseon webpage more accessible it will now be more user friendly for viewers using assistive technology as well as adding some search engine optimization.
- I learnt a lot about GitHub and SEO as well as a good start with HTML and CSS.
